## DESCRIPTION

The objective of this project was to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

## SCREENSHOTS

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality on a laptop:
